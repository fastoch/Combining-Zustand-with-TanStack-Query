# Intro

Combining **Zustand** and **TanStack Query** is a common and **recommended** practice, as each solves a different **state management** need in **React** apps: 
- Zustand is ideal for global client-side management state
- TanStack Query excels at synchronizing and caching server data

Most modern apps benefit from using TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for client state, maintaining clear "**separation of concerns**".
